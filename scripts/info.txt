Amazon jdbc driver for postgres if using Aurora:
https://github.com/aws/aws-advanced-jdbc-wrapper/releases

For db creation pay attention to:
Connectivity
Additional configuration
Public access
Publicly accessible
if you want to access database outside of Amazon EC2

Note - for production use cases you either make it publicly available and restrict access to single IP or only user Amazon EC2 instances
